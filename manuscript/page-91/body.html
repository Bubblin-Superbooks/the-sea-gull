[Embracing her] Oh, if you could only know what it is to have lost everything under heaven! She does not love me. I see I shall never be able to write. Every hope has deserted me.</p><p>ARKADINA. Don’t despair. This will all pass. He is going away to-day, and she will love you once more. [She wipes away his tears] Stop crying. We have made peace again.</p><p>TREPLIEFF. [Kissing her hand] Yes, mother.</p><p>ARKADINA. [Tenderly] Make your peace with him, too. Don’t fight with him. You surely won’t fight?</p></div> </div>
