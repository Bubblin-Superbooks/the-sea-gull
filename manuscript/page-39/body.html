There are six houses on its shores. All was noise and laughter and romance then, such romance! The young star and idol of them all in those days was this man here, [Nods toward DORN] Doctor Eugene Dorn. He is fascinating now, but he was irresistible then. But my conscience is beginning to prick me. Why did I hurt my poor boy? I am uneasy about him. [Loudly] Constantine! Constantine!</p><p>MASHA. Shall I go and find him?</p><p>ARKADINA. If you please, my dear.</p><p>MASHA. [Goes off to the left, calling] Mr. Constantine! Oh, Mr. Constantine!</p><p>NINA. [Comes in from behind the stage] I see that the play will never be finished, so now I can go home. Good evening. [She kisses ARKADINA and PAULINA.]</p><p>SORIN. Bravo! Bravo!</p></div> </div>
