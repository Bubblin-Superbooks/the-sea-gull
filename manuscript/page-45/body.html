An insufferable creature.</p><p>DORN. Constantine, your play delighted me. It was strange, of course, and I did not hear the end, but it made a deep impression on me. You have a great deal of talent, and must persevere in your work.</p><p>TREPLIEFF seizes his hand and squeezes it hard, then kisses him impetuously.</p><p>DORN. Tut, tut! how excited you are. Your eyes are full of tears. Listen to me. You chose your subject in the realm of abstract thought, and you did quite right. A work of art should invariably embody some lofty idea. Only that which is seriously meant can ever be beautiful. How pale you are!</p><p>TREPLIEFF. So you advise me to persevere?</p></div> </div>
