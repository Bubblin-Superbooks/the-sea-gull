I hope you enjoy the consolation it brings.</p><p>TREPLIEFF. [With irony] Those who are really gifted, indeed! [Angrily] I am cleverer than any of you, if it comes to that! [He tears the bandage off his head] You are the slaves of convention, you have seized the upper hand and now lay down as law everything that you do; all else you strangle and trample on. I refuse to accept your point of view, yours and his, I refuse!</p><p>ARKADINA. That is the talk of a decadent.</p><p>TREPLIEFF. Go back to your beloved stage and act the miserable ditch-water plays you so much admire!</p><p>ARKADINA. I never acted in a play like that in my life. You couldnâ€™t write even the trashiest music-hall farce, you idle good-for-nothing!</p><p>TREPLIEFF. Miser!</p></div> </div>
