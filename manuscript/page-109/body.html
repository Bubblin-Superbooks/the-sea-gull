<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>DORN and MEDVIEDENKO come in through the door on the left, wheeling SORIN in an arm-chair.</p><p>MEDVIEDENKO. I have six mouths to feed now, and flour is at seventy kopecks.</p><p>DORN. A hard riddle to solve!</p><p>MEDVIEDENKO. It is easy for you to make light of it. You are rich enough to scatter money to your chickens, if you wanted to.</p><p>DORN. You think I am rich? My friend, after practising for thirty years, during which I could not call my soul my own for one minute of the night or day, I succeeded at last in scraping together one thousand roubles, all of which went, not long ago, in a trip which I took abroad. I haven’t a penny.</p><p>MASHA. [To her husband] So you didn’t go home after all?</p><p>MEDVIEDENKO. [Apologetically] How can I go home when they won’t give me a horse?</p></div> </div>
