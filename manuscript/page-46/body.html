I have led a quiet life, as you know, and am a contented man, but if I should ever experience the exaltation that an artist feels during his moments of creation, I think I should spurn this material envelope of my soul and everything connected with it, and should soar away into heights above this earth.</p><p>TREPLIEFF. I beg your pardon, but where is Nina?</p><p>DORN. And yet another thing: every work of art should have a definite object in view. You should know why you are writing, for if you follow the road of art without a goal before your eyes, you will lose yourself, and your genius will be your ruin.</p><p>TREPLIEFF. [Impetuously] Where is Nina?</p><p>DORN. She has gone home.</p><p>TREPLIEFF. [In despair] Gone home? What shall I do? I want to see her; I must see her! I shall follow her.</p><p>DORN. My dear boy, keep quiet.</p></div> </div>
